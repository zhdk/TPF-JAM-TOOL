# TPF-JAM-TOOL

## About

TPF-JAM-TOOL is a low-latency 'jamming tool' that connects sixteen different jamming partners/locations. 
(Mac only)  
TPF-JAM-TOOL further develops the previous tools '[tpf-tools](https://telematicperformance.com/tools/)' and 'TPF-JAM-BASIC'. [Reaper.fm](https://www.reaper.fm/) is one of the most widely used digital audio workstations (DAW) today. Reaper, as a DAW, is our choice because most of the parameters in Reaper can be operated via scripts ([LuaScript](https://dail8859.github.io/LuaScript/)) and are available for retrieval, as well as having early audio routing. The idea behind the TPF-JAM-TOOL is to provide a very easy-to-use bundle with a wide variety of possibilities. In connection with the SNSF research project '[spatial-dis-continuities-in-telematic-performances](https://networkperformance.space)', many features have been incorporated into this tool. 
Over the years, we spent many hours communicating over Zoom as a team of artists and researchers, which always tired us out quickly from an acoustic point of view. After experimenting with Ambisonics and Binaural rendering, many of us became less tired because a more natural hearing sensation set in, especially in music making.

This was the primary motivation to integrate the 3D audio research '[Ambisonics at ICST](https://ambisonics.ch/)' into the telematic applications in the [spatial-dis-continuities-in-telematic-performances](https://www.zhdk.ch/en/researchproject/575742) project.
The tools are freely available, and while the installation may take some time, it's a worthwhile investment. 
The TPF-Client application handles firewall and IT settings, allowing you to focus on immediately connecting with other musicians and starting to jam. The digital audio workstation "Reaper 7.16"(the newest) is your digital mixing console. You can mix the incoming signals in a virtual room with Reaper and the pre-installed third-party plugins.
Of course, the mix can also be recorded directly in Reaper, providing an instant recording of your jamming session.

And now .... let's jam...

## Usage

### Quick Start 
You have completed all pre-installations and are up to date.

--> Restart Computer!
1. first setup your Audio Interface and Hardware components, e.g.
	- Mic (CH1)
	- Instrument (Keyboard) (CH2)
2. be sure that your hardware works correctly with your Mac/PC
3. create an Aggregate (Mac) and name it as shown in the following picture. The correct order of components is crucial. (Windows take [Virtual cable](https://vb-audio.com/Services/licensing.htm) (Donate $)
4. by Mail invitation from 'Bandleader', you get all the needed information, like server address, room, and link to Livelab
5. open Reaper, then choose "Setting" -> "Device" and select your 'Aggregate TPF-JAM-TOOL'.
6. the left toolbar of the Reaper template contains all the necessary functions for a telematic connection.
7. press the button 'tpf-client on'
8. go to Settings in 'tpf-client', and add your <location-name> and the <jamming-room-name>.
9. before connecting to the server, check your inputs in Reaper and unmute your local inputs 1 and 2 (the channels in tpf-client are green flickering)
10. to connect to the server, click the top left square in the tpf-client. If connected, it will turn blue. 
11. one by one, all fellow musicians/locations will appear. You can connect by clicking the square on the left. You should now hear them all.
12. click "[LiveLab](https://www.culturehub.org/livelab) on' in the left toolbar of Reaper, and your main browser will open. Type in the LiveLab URL you received from the bandleader. In the settings of LiveLab choose 'no audio'.
13. then click 'start'. You should now be connected by video. 
    (set Google-Chrome.app as your main Browser)

Your audio should be connected to the TPF client and all other musicians/locations. You are connected to video via LiveLab in the Chrome browser. 
So, happy jamming...
